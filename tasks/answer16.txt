Caregiver: that word should weigh more than others on a page, sag it down a 
bit and wrinkle it, because the simple-sounding job frazzles as it consumes 
and depletes. Not that it's only gloomy. Caregiving offers many fringe

sharing, and playing. There's something uniquely fulfilling about being a 
lodestar, feeling so deeply needed, and it's fun finding creative ways to 
gladden a loved one's life. But caregiving does buttonhole you; you're 
stitched in one place.  -- Diane Ackerman on family
