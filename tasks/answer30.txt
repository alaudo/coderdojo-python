Fat people, it is commonly held, should be punished because they offend our

airplanes, and elevators. They consume more than they contribute to 
society. They become ill and need to be taken care of, or they die early 
and their families are left unsupported. The only way fat people can gain 
some acceptance and forgiveness for their crime of overeating is to at 
least try, or look like they are trying, to lose weight. They must never 
eat an ice cream cone in public, never be seen eating a normal sized
