The quality of mercy is not strain'd, It droppeth as the gentle rain from 
heaven Upon the place beneath. It is twice blest: It blesseth him that 
gives and him that takes. 'T is mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes The 
throned monarch better than his crown; His sceptre shows the force of 
temporal power, The attribute to awe and majesty, Wherein doth sit the 
dread and fear of kings; But mercy is above this sceptred sway, It is 
enthroned in the hearts of kings, It is an attribute to God himself; And 
earthly power doth then show likest God's, When mercy seasons justice. 
Therefore, Jew, Though justice be thy plea, consider this, That in the 
course of justice none of us Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy; 
And that same prayer doth teach us all to render The deeds of mercy.  -- 
William Shakespeare on mercy
