Passive acceptance of the teacher's wisdom is easy to most boys and girls. 
It involves no effort of independent thought, and seems rational because 
the teacher knows more than his pupils; it is moreover the way to win the 
favour of the teacher unless he is a very exceptional man. Yet the habit of 
passive acceptance is a disastrous one in later life. It causes man to seek 
and to accept a leader, and to accept as a leader whoever is established in 
that position.  -- Bertrand Russell on teaching
