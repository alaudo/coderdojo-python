A person can learn a lot from a dog, even a loopy one like ours. Marley 
taught me about living each day with unbridled exuberance and joy, about 
seizing the moment and following your heart. He taught me to appreciate the

in the face of adversity. Mostly, he taught me about friendship and

Here�s my theory about meetings and life; the three things you can�t fake 
are erections, competence and creativity. That�s why meetings become toxic 
they put uncreative people in a situation in which they have to be 
something they can never be. And the more effort they put into concealing 
their inabilities, the more toxic the meeting becomes. One of the most 
common creativity-faking tactics is when someone puts their hands in prayer 
position and conceals their mouth while they nod at you and say, 'Mmmmmm. 
Interesting.' If pressed, they�ll add, 'I�ll have to get back to you on 
that.' Then they don�t say anything else.  -- Douglas Coupland on business
