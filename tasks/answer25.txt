I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties 
than standing armies. If the American people ever allow private banks to 
control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, 
the banks and corporations that will grow up around [the banks] will 
deprive the people of all property until their children wake-up homeless on 
the continent their fathers conquered. The issuing power should be taken 
from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs.  --

Here�s my theory about meetings and life; the three things you can�t fake 
are erections, competence and creativity. That�s why meetings become toxic 
they put uncreative people in a situation in which they have to be 
something they can never be. And the more effort they put into concealing 
their inabilities, the more toxic the meeting becomes. One of the most 
common creativity-faking tactics is when someone puts their hands in prayer 
position and conceals their mouth while they nod at you and say, 'Mmmmmm. 
Interesting.' If pressed, they�ll add, 'I�ll have to get back to you on

have groupies." But my idea of success is different today. For me, the most
