CoderDojo Intermediate Python Course

## About this course
This repository contains the course material for the intermediate Python course I taught as a part of the CoderDojo workshops in March, 2016.

The course consists of three sessions and targets primarily students who have some basic knowledge of Python as well as good understanding of the main CS concepts, like variables, control flow, containers etc.

Every session is supposed to last for about 2 hours which are mostly filled with the presentation and live coding.
