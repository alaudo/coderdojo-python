#CoderDojo Intermediate Python Course

## About this course
This repository contains the course material for the intermediate Python course I taught as a part of the CoderDojo workshops in March, 2016.

The course consists of three sessions and targets primarily students who have some basic knowledge of Python as well as good understanding of the main CS concepts, like variables, control flow, containers etc.

Every session is supposed to last for about 2 hours which are mostly filled with the presentation and live coding.

### Folder structure
<pre>
|-tasks          => offline tasks for the sessions without Internet access
|-code           => sample solutions to the tasks and demos from the presentation
~-presentation   => presentation in PPTX format
</pre>
### Enigma code game
An essential part of the course is an online competitive game called 'Enigma Code' that is available at: http://enigmacode.azurewebsites.net

The goal of the game is to decode messages that might be encrypted using different simple text transformation (reversing, duplication, Ceasar shift code etc.). With increasing score the difficulty also goes up: the message can be encrypted simultaneously with several different ciphers. The "Hints" section usually contains enough information to guess the type of the cipher, how many and in what order are applied to the text.

The game is currently hosted on a free tier of Microsoft Azure and might become less responsive if used by many users. Hence, please, if you plan to use this page for your course, let me know so I can increase the performance of the service instance. The source code of the game is also available in the 'enigmacode' repository for you self hosting.

If you are not sure about Internet access for your students you can use pre-generated cipher tasks from the 'tasks' folder.
